#  Honeycomb Pattern

This repository contains a simple web-based honeycomb pattern page. When you hover your mouse over the screen, it lights up the hexagons, creating a fun and interactive effect. Built using HTML and CSS. This can also be used as a simple UI component to add interactive honeycomb patterns to web projects. 🖥️✨
